The main Shiny app is in server.R and ui.R

Full_data.csv is our CSV file after it has been modified to include full department names which have been scraped from the UW major abbreviation list.

Data\_test.R creates full_data.csv but is unused in the final project

Course_scraper.py is a python script written by Jacob to scrape Course Evaluations from the online catalog. Due to limitations with the data, course evaluation data was not included in the final project but the scraper was left because it was interesting to build.
