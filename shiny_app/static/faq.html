	<h3>What Data does this Site Show?</h3>
		<div>
			<p>This website uses the grade distributions from all University of Washington classes between 2010 and 2016. This data is used to give students insights about their classes and professors beyond the course evaluation catalog and ratemyprofessor.</p>
   		</div>
    <h3>Where did we get this data?</h3>
    	<div>
    		<p>All grade data was obtained by Austin Walters via FOIA request for Easy A, a student advising website. Visit easy-a.net for more information.</p>

    <h3>What is the Freedom of Information Act?</h3>
    	<div>
    		<p>The FOIA is a law signed by Lyndon B Johnson in 1966 that states that federal agencies must allow the public to request records for any reason. Since the University of Washington is a public university, the FOIA allows us to request grade data as long as the data requested does not violate the privacy of any student. This means that we can obtain grade distributions, but not a specific student's grades.</p>
